Visit our Hugging Face or ModelScope organization (click links above), search checkpoints with names starting with `Qwen1.5-`, and you will find all you need! Enjoy!



## Introduction
This time, we upgrade Qwen to Qwen1.5, the beta version of Qwen2. Similar to Qwen, it is still a decoder-only transformer model with SwiGLU activation, RoPE, multi-head attention. At this moment, we have achieved:
* 6 model sizes: 0.5B, 1.8B, 4B, 7B, 14B, and 72B;
* Significant model quality improvements in chat models;
* Strengthened multilingual capabilities in both base and chat models;
* All models support the context length of `32768` tokens;
* System prompts enabled for all models, which means roleplay is possible.
* No need of `trust_remote_code` anymore.

We have not integrated GQA and mixture of SWA and full attention in this version and we will add the features in the future version.


## News
* 2024.02.05: We released the Qwen1.5 series.

## Performance
Detailed evaluation results are reported in this <a href="https://qwenlm.github.io"> üìë blog</a>.


## Requirements
* `transformers>=4.37.0`. 

> [!Warning]
> <div align="center">
> <b>
> üö® This is a must because `transformers` integrated Qwen2 codes since `4.37.0`.

## Quickstart

### ü§ó Hugging Face Transformers

Here we show a code snippet to show you how to use the chat model with `transformers`:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
device = "cuda" # the device to load the model onto

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen1.5-72B-Chat",
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto"
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen1.5-72B-Chat")

prompt = "Give me a short introduction to large language model."
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]
text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)
model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(device)

generated_ids = model.generate(
    model_inputs.input_ids,
    max_new_tokens=512
)
generated_ids = [
    output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]

response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
```

For quantized models, we advise you to use the GPTQ and AWQ correspondents, namely `Qwen1.5-7B-Chat-GPTQ-Int8`, `Qwen1.5-7B-Chat-AWQ`. 

### ü§ñ ModelScope
We strongly advise users especially those in mainland China to use ModelScope. `snapshot_download` can help you solve issues concerning downloading checkpoints.

### üíª Run locally

#### llama.cpp
Download our provided GGUF files or create them by yourself, and you can directly use them with the latest [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) with a one-line command:
```shell
./main -m <path-to-file> -n 512 --color -i -cml -f prompts/chat-with-qwen.txt
```

#### Ollama
We are now on Ollama, and you can use `pull` and `run` to make things work.
```shell
ollama run qwen
```
You can also add things like `::14B` to choose different models. Visit [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai/) for more information.

#### LMStudio
Qwen1.5 has already been supported by [lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai/). You can directly use LMStudio with our GGUF files.



## Web UI

#### Text generation web UI
You can directly use [`text-generation-webui`](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) for creating a web UI demo. If you use GGUF, remember to install the latest wheel of `llama.cpp` with the support of Qwen1.5.


#### llamafile
Clone [`llamafile`](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile), run source install, and then create your own llamafile with the GGUF file following the guide [here](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile?tab=readme-ov-file#creating-llamafiles). You are able to run one line of command, say `./qwen.llamafile`, to create a demo.


## Deployment
Now, Qwen1.5 is supported by multiple inference frameworks. Here we demonstrate the usage of `vLLM` and `SGLang`.

> [!Note]
> <div align="center">
> Neither vLLM nor SGLang currently offer built-in support for <b>function calling</b>. If you require tool use capabilities, please refer to <a href="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent">Qwen-Agent</a>, which provides a wrapper around these APIs to support function calling.
> </div>

### vLLM
We advise you to use `vLLM>=0.3.0` to build OpenAI-compatible API service. Start the server with a chat model, e.g. `Qwen1.5-7B-Chat`:
```shell
python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server --model Qwen/Qwen1.5-7B-Chat
```

Then use the chat API as demonstrated below:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen1.5-7B-Chat",
    "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me something about large language models."}
    ]
    }'
```
```python
from openai import OpenAI
# Set OpenAI's API key and API base to use vLLM's API server.
openai_api_key = "EMPTY"
openai_api_base = "http://localhost:8000/v1"

client = OpenAI(
    api_key=openai_api_key,
    base_url=openai_api_base,
)

chat_response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="Qwen/Qwen1.5-7B-Chat",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me something about large language models."},
    ]
)
print("Chat response:", chat_response)
```

### SGLang
Please install `SGLang` from source. Similar to `vLLM`, you need to launch a server and use OpenAI-compatible API service. Start the server first:
```shell
python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen1.5-7B-Chat --port 30000
```
You can use it in Python as shown below:
```python
from sglang import function, system, user, assistant, gen, set_default_backend, RuntimeEndpoint

@function
def multi_turn_question(s, question_1, question_2):
    s += system("You are a helpful assistant.")
    s += user(question_1)
    s += assistant(gen("answer_1", max_tokens=256))
    s += user(question_2)
    s += assistant(gen("answer_2", max_tokens=256))

set_default_backend(RuntimeEndpoint("http://localhost:30000"))

state = multi_turn_question.run(
    question_1="What is the capital of China?",
    question_2="List two local attractions.",
)

for m in state.messages():
    print(m["role"], ":", m["content"])

print(state["answer_1"])
```

## Finetuning
We advise you to use training frameworks, including [Axolotl](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl), [Llama-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory), [Swift](https://github.com/modelscope/swift), etc., to finetune your models with SFT, DPO, PPO, etc.

## API
Qwen1.5 models are now deployed on both [DashScope](https://dashscope.aliyun.com/) and [Together](https://api.together.ai/). Check [this](https://api.together.xyz/playground/chat/Qwen/Qwen1.5-72B-Chat) out and have fun with Qwen1.5-72B-Chat!

## License Agreement
Check the license of each model inside its HF repo. It is NOT necessary for you to submit a request for commercial usage.
